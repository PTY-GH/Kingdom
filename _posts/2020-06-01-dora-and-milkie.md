You can not resist a strawberry on top of your vanilla ice cream, and Milkie has to get her bestie as her homie.

## Dora
Dora is sweetie strawberry at home, but a <strong><span style='color=red'>spicy chili</span></strong> at work. Dora has a huge <strong><span style='color=pink'>crush<span></strong> on some guy in the kingdom.

## Milkie
Vanilla goes along with everyone, but only the bestie knows Milkie's <strong>moo</strong> point.
